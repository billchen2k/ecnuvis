abstract: "Music and visual arts are essential in childrenâ€™s arts education, and their integration has garnered significant attention. Existing data analysis methods for exploring audio-visual correlations are limited. Yet, relevant research is necessary for innovating and promoting arts integration courses. In our work, we collected substantial volumes of music-inspired doodles created by children and interviewed education experts to comprehend the challenges they encountered in the relevant analysis. Based on the insights we obtained, we designed and constructed an interactive visualization system DoodleTunes. DoodleTunes integrates deep learning-driven methods for automatically annotating several types of data features. The visual designs of the system are based on a four-level analysis structure to construct a progressive workflow, facilitating data exploration and insight discovery between doodle images and corresponding music pieces. We evaluated the accuracy of our feature prediction results and collected usage feedback on DoodleTunes from five domain experts."
